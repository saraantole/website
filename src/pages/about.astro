          <h2>Where I Come From</h2>
          <p>
            My passion for programming wasn't at first sight. Before starting my
            journey into the tech world, I graduated in Business and Tourism
            Translation. Once I finished university, I got into online marketing
            which gave me a broad perspective on people, systems, and
            problem-solving. This zigzag across fields shaped my approach:
            combining <b>technical expertise with human understanding</b> and aesthetic
            judgment. Now I’m a Senior AI Fullstack Engineer at a leading Web3 company,
            with a passion for building <b
              >high-quality, human-centered technology</b
            >.
          </p>

          <h2>What I Do</h2>
          <p>
            Over the years, I’ve led numerous <b>user-focused products</b>, won
            multiple hackathons, and built systems that blend performance,
            security, and elegance. I run an <b>AI consultancy firm</b>, helping
            businesses improve focus, productivity, and workflows through
            thoughtful, human-centered solutions. I also build <b
              >products focused on health, focus, and wellbeing</b
            >, using technology to create meaningful, sustainable impact.
          </p>

          <h2>My Why</h2>
          <p>
            I believe technology should be at <b
              >the service of a more human life</b
            >. AI, blockchain, and emerging systems only create value when they
            are used with intention. My work focuses on <b
              >quiet technology with real impact</b
            >—systems that respect human attention, free focus and creative
            energy, and support a more intentional way of working and living. I
            strongly believe that technology should <b
              >reduce cognitive load instead of increasing it, creating space
              for creativity, clarity, and wellbeing</b
            >. Tech is not the goal—people are. When used consciously,
            technology becomes a tool that frees energy instead of consuming it.
          </p>

          <h2>What I Love</h2>
          <p>
            I love understanding the “why” behind things and seeing ideas turn
            into tools that make life easier or more intentional. I enjoy
            sharing thoughts and perspectives on how technology can truly
            support human focus, wellbeing, and productivity. I also collaborate
            with like-minded people, speak at conferences, and exchange ideas
            with others who share a vision for <b
              >technology that serves humans</b
            >. Outside work, you’ll probably find me learning or exploring nerdy
            things, dancing Bachata, spending time in nature, doing manual
            crafts, traveling, or enjoying homemade desserts—simple ways to stay
            grounded and inspired.
          </p>

          <p>
            Last but not least, I enjoy connecting with curious minds who care
            about technology, creativity, and making things that actually
            matter. Whether you'd like to collaborate on a project, exchange
            ideas, or just have a conversation about AI, Web3, or building
            meaningful products, I’d be happy to chat.
          </p>
